# DLNA Player
DLNA Player is a software that acts as a server and as a controller. Simply, select a renderer, drag and drop your music files, and play them to your renderer.

The software will play the next track when the current track finishes playing. Because it is a controller software, you can also pause and resume, stop, or play the next or previous tracks. Also, you can use the Track Seek Bar to seek the audio track.

Additionally, you can play back music files stored in your Google Drive account:
